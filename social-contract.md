# App Name
*description will go here*

## Roles
* Taskmaster (keep track of todos / issues, assign pairs and tasks each day, facilitate communication)
* Gitmaster (make sure commits, pull requests, and pull request views are happening regularly)
* Testmaster (make sure tests are being written, consider edge cases)
* Project manager (simulation of “agile”, customize support for team)

## Daily process
* 11:15am stand-up – each teammate provides updates on their accomplishments from the day before and flags any upcoming blockers/general issues; review and delegate daily tasks in Asana; merge
* 4:30pm stand-up – give status update and share feedback on pull requests
* EOD/before morning stand-up – send a final update via Discord


## Team expectations
* Each of us reserves the rights to our nights and weekends, and we have all been
straightforward about when and how we can commit to working on the project
* If you have a blocking issue, slack before interrupting another’s train of coding-thought
* We will assign tasks vertically (instead of horizontally)
* None of us will specialize in terms of front-end and back-end code
* Don’t interrupt - raise your hand
* Share the mic
* Disagree often and discuss -- argue infrequently
* At least message the group when you change what you are working on

## Norms 
* Same as class norms (e.g. timeliness, cameras on, empathic and respectful communication)
* Respect each other’s time and boundaries
* Everyone is committed to attending stand-ups and being present online from 9:30am-6pm
* Everyone is welcomed to work additionally outside of normal hours but should not rely on other teammates’ availability or responsiveness outside of normal hours unless pre-planned (and don’t feel bad saying “no”)
* Don’t spend more than 30 minutes trying to resolve a problem on your own; ask for help
* Implement help ticket format when requesting help via Slack
* No one will specialize; we will all share responsibilities equally and have opportunities to develop a well-rounded skill set throughout this project
* Ensure consensus before decisions are made
* Communicate when tasks are completed and when you’re starting on something new (don’t charge ahead without conferring with teammates)
* Prioritize self care by taking breaks, and staying rested, hydrated, and socially connected
* When possible, share your knowledge and expertise with your teammates so everyone can capitalize on learning opportunities and opportunities to learn via teaching; make sure we all understand every component of the code
* When frustrated or disagreeing with a teammate, exercise patience, speak constructively and with empathy to resolve issues; seek support and guidance from mentors and instructors if you are struggling or uncomfortable
* Revisit norms as needed; be flexible

## Issues
*  If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:
1. Take 10-15 minute break
2. List out the pros / cons
3. Vote on it
4. If the vote is split, escalate to a fellow or instructor
* If you are frustrated
  * Take a walk or get some water
  * Talk constructively about actionable items (e.g. raise your hand instead of interrupting, let me learn and struggle until I ask you for help, etc.)
  * Bring in a 3rd party (e.g. fellow, instructor) to mediate if you feel too frustrate
